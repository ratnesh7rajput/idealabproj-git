# eCourt
This is a project related to eCourt. Our aim is to build a keyword based search engine for the ease of judge. 
When the judge will type initial letters to search for a perticular case our system will suggest the potential result.
Not only that our system will also consists of a feature where the softcopy documentation of the case is uploaded through our portal and based on the keywords our system will suggest most suitable previous case verdicts.
With the help of this feature the time taken by the judge to pass a verdict on similar cases will get reduce.

### How we will work
Our team consists of 6 members, each member will work on their separate branch and once the tester validates the feature then only that feature from the branch will be added in the main branch.
